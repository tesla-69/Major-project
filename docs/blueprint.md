## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep purple (#673AB7) to evoke intelligence and focus, fitting for a brain-computer interface application.
- Background color: Light lavender (#EDE7F6), a very desaturated shade of purple, creating a soft and unobtrusive backdrop to focus on the blinking task.
- Accent color: Electric indigo (#7C4DFF), a brighter shade of purple shifted slightly in hue, used for interactive elements like the scanning highlight in the character grid.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, chosen for its modern, neutral, and readable qualities which ensure clarity for all users.
- Clean and simple layout with high contrast between text and background to ensure readability for visually impaired users.
- Subtle and clear animations to guide the user through the character selection process, ensuring timing is easy to perceive.
